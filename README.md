# Reconnect

Reconnect is a modern reimagining of the New York Times "Connections" game â€” but better. 
With Reconnect, you can play through all puzzles without daily limits, track your progress locally, and enjoy a clean, mobile-first experience.

Built entirely in **React Native** with **Expo** and **AsyncStorage**, Reconnect stores all your game data locally, ensuring you can play offline anytime â€” no backend required.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Unlimited Puzzles** â€“ Play through the full library without waiting for the next day.
- ðŸ“± **Offline Play** â€“ Thanks to AsyncStorage, all game state and progress are saved locally.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Modern UI** â€“ Smooth animations and intuitive design for an enjoyable experience.
- ðŸ§© **Better Than the Original** â€“ More puzzles, no ads, and improved UX.
- ðŸš« **No Backend Needed** â€“ Fast and lightweight, with everything stored on your device.
